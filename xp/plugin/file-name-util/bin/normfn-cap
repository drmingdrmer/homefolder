# Same as normfn.sh but capitalize the words.


# BEGIN{FS=OFS="-"}: Sets both the input and output field separator to "-".
# for(i=1;i<=NF;i++): Loops through each field (word) in the input.
# $i=toupper(substr($i,1,1)) substr($i,2): For each field, it capitalizes the first character and keeps the rest unchanged.
# toupper(substr($i,1,1)): Capitalizes the first character of the field.
# substr($i,2): Returns the rest of the characters in the field (from the second character onward).
# The 1 at the end of the awk command is a common idiom that means "print the line" after processing.
