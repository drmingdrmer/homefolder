# Format python source codes with autopep8 on changed lines.
#
# Usage:
#   format all uncommitted lines:
#   > p8ln
#
#   format file:
#   > p8ln a.py b.py
#
# ---
# # Explaination:
#
# # show all changed file names:
#   git diff --name-only --relative HEAD
#
# And a helper script `git-changed-ln` outputs changed line numbers,
# by diff work-tree(unstaged) with HEAD,
# or by diff index(staged or cached) with HEAD.
