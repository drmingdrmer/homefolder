About the Arrows

There are about 611 arrows. These are from several different sections of
Unicode, including:

  • Miscellaneous Symbols
  • Dingbats
  • Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-A
  • Supplemental Arrows-A
  • Supplemental Arrows-B
  • Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B
  • Supplemental Mathematical Operators
  • Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows

It took me several days to collect and organize these arrows. They are
scattered in different places, and are hard to find. Also, there are a lot
symmetry issues, and some mirror image isn't there. Here's some details of my
experience.

Note: each Unicode character has a ID called its “codepoint”. For example, →
has codepoint 8594 or hexadecimal 2192.

Scattered All Over

They are scattered in different code blocks. The most common ones are collected
in “Symbols, Arrows (2190–21FF)”. In the beginning of Unicode history, there's
just a right pointing arrow of a particular style, because left pointing ones
are seldomly or never used. But later, it's realized the left pointing ones are
important too, for one reason or another, and sometimes there's a need just for
completeness because Unicode became more wide spread. So, the left pointing
ones get added, in the same block but different neighborhood, or in another
block. Thus you have “Supplemental Arrows-A” and “Supplemental Arrows-B”. For
similar reasons, other symmetric versions of the same style such as upward and
or downward versions are scattered in wildly different blocks.

For example, here's some arrows and their names:

Codepoint Char         Name             Date Added
U+2B05    ⬅    LEFTWARDS BLACK ARROW Unicode 4 (2003)
U+2B06    ⬆    UPWARDS BLACK ARROW   Unicode 4 (2003)
U+2B07    ⬇    DOWNWARDS BLACK ARROW Unicode 4 (2003)

However, there was no “RIGHTWARDS BLACK ARROW” for about 10 years. The closest
is this:

Codepoint Char             Name                 Date Added
U+27A1    ➡    BLACK RIGHTWARDS ARROW        Unicode 1 (1991)
               (old name: BLACK RIGHT ARROW)

You can see that, this right pointing arrow was there first. The others are
added later. The names are inconsistent.

Finally, in Unicode 7, a new one with consistent name is added.

Codepoint Char          Name             Date Added
U+2B95    ⮕    RIGHTWARDS BLACK ARROW Unicode 7 (2014)

Now we have a ugly situation. There are 2 of them {➡, ⮕}. According to Unicode,
they should be rendered in the same style as the other 3 for up/left/down. But,
as of 2017-10-11, only the first one is rendered in the same style.

Missing Symmetric Versions

Lots of these arrows are from math, but some are also used elsewhere. The
problem is, it's hard to categorize them into one place. So, in Unicode, the
arrows gets into one of these blocks: “Miscellaneous Mathematical Symbols-B”,
“Supplemental Mathematical Operators”, “Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows”.
Often, the left/right pair and the up/down pair are in different blocks.

Here's a example: ⇺ ⇻ ⇼ ⇞ ⇟. There does not seem to have a vertical version of
⇼. The chars ⇞ ⇟ are in category “Symbol, other”, while ⇺ ⇻ ⇼ are in category
“Symbol, Math”.

Another example: ⥂ ⥃ ⥄. Note that there is no right pointing version of ⥄ as of
2017-10-11 (Unicode 10) .

Many arrows do not have symmetric versions. Symmetry here can be reflection
thru vertical or horizontal axes, or n*90° rotation, or combination of them.
The following are some set of chars missing symmetric versions: ↴ ↵ ↸ ↹ ⤺ ⤻ ⤼ ⤽
⤪ ⤨ ⤧ ⤩ ⤭ ⤮ ⤯ ⤰ ⤱ ⤲.

Ordering Problem

Also, when trying to order them, i ran into the problem of devising a ordering
scheme. For example, usually i order them by left right up down, like this:. ←
→ ↑ ↓. But now look at these: ⇆ ⇄ ⇅ ⇵. For the vertical pair, which should come
first?

Here's another example of the complexity. There are these chars:

Character                Unicode Name
↶         ANTICLOCKWISE TOP SEMICIRCLE ARROW
↷         CLOCKWISE TOP SEMICIRCLE ARROW
⤾         LOWER RIGHT SEMICIRCULAR CLOCKWISE ARROW
⤿         LOWER LEFT SEMICIRCULAR ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW
⤸         RIGHT-SIDE ARC CLOCKWISE ARROW
⤹         LEFT-SIDE ARC ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW
⤺         TOP ARC ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW
⤻         BOTTOM ARC ANTICLOCKWISE ARROW

If you analyze their names, you can see that a circle can be divided into 8
arcs: {left, right, top, bottom}, and 4 of the diagonal arcs. Each arc can be
clockwise or anti-clockwise. 8 arcs, 2 directions, there are a combination of
16 possibilities. First of all, note that not all of them is present. (For
example, there's no char named “TOP ARC CLOCKWISE ARROW”) But given these
chars, how do you order them?

Font Problems

Note that some left/right pairs looks very different, even in the same font.

For example, here's how they render in your browser:

Character Code Point          Unicode Name
⬾         U+2B3E     LEFTWARDS ARROW THROUGH X
⥇         U+2947     RIGHTWARDS ARROW THROUGH X
⬲         U+2B32     LEFT ARROW WITH CIRCLED PLUS
⟴         U+27F4     RIGHT ARROW WITH CIRCLED PLUS
⬳         U+2B33     LONG LEFTWARDS SQUIGGLE ARROW
⟿         U+27FF     LONG RIGHTWARDS SQUIGGLE ARROW
⬱         U+2B31     THREE LEFTWARDS ARROWS
⇶         U+21F6     THREE RIGHTWARDS ARROWS

How the chars shows up on your screen may be very different from another
person. It depends on your operating system, web browser, your browser and OS
configuration, and availability of font on your system.

Typically, the rightward versions have correctly designed fonts, because it is
far more popularly used. The leftward version, or other directions, sometimes
get added as afterthought or extensions.
