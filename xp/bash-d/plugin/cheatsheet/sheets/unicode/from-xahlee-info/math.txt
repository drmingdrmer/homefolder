What Chars Are Included

These are roughly all math symbols under the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). A
symbol is considered a math symbol if its Unicode name indicate so, or, it is
widely recognized as a math symbol (such as ℝ ⅈ π). The total number of chars
on this page is about 766.

For arrows and bracketing chars, if a char's Unicode name does not explicitly
indicate that it is a operator or math symbol, they are not included here. For
a list of them, see:

  • Unicode: Arrow Symbols ← → ↑ ↓
  • Unicode: Brackets, Quotes «»「」【】《》
  • Unicode Box Lines ┌ Blocks ▓
  • Unicode Geometric Shapes ■
  • APL Programing Language Symbols

There are more math symbols but are outside of BMP. In particular, there are
several complete set of styled English alphabet, such as double-struck chars (ℂ
ℝ ⅈ ⅉ) gothic-styled letters (ℭ ℑ ℌ ℜ ℨ), scripted letter forms (ℓ ℱ ℒ ℛ).

For a complete list, see:

  • Math Font ℤ ℚ ℝ ℂ
  • Unicode: Greek Alphabet α β γ

Unicode Names for Symbol's Meaning

The symbols are roughly grouped by purpose, and with respect to the symbol's
semantics, as opposed to their appearance.

For example, there are many similar looking symbols, and in different fonts
they may look different or identical. Example:

  • ~ TILDE
  • ∼ TILDE OPERATOR
  • ∽ REVERSED TILDE
  • 〜 WAVE DASH
  • ∿ SINE WAVE
  • ≈ ALMOST EQUAL TO

Another example:

  • ⩳ EQUALS SIGN ABOVE TILDE OPERATOR
  • ≌ ALL EQUAL TO
  • ⩯ ALMOST EQUAL TO WITH CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT
  • ⩰ APPROXIMATELY EQUAL OR EQUAL TO

The Unicode names give indication of the symbol's meaning. There are some 20
more symbols that's made up wavy line(s) and or horizontal line(s). When you
choose a symbol, your choice should be based on the symbol's meaning according
to the symbol's Unicode name, when possible. Because what you see as rendered
by a font may be very different from another font, and often font designers
simply got the shape wrong, especially for less common chars.
