Other superscript and subscript characters[edit]

Unicode version 11.0 also includes subscript and superscript characters that
are intended for semantic usage, in the following blocks:^[1]^[6]

  • The Latin-1 Supplement block contains the feminine and masculine ordinal
    indicators ª and º.
  • The Latin Extended-C block contains one additional superscript, ⱽ, and one
    additional subscript ⱼ.
  • The Latin Extended-D block contains three superscripts: ꝰ ꟸ ꟹ.
  • The Latin Extended-E block contains four superscripts: ꭜ ꭝ ꭞ ꭟ.
  • The Combining Diacritical Marks block contains medieval superscript letter
    diacritics. These letters are written directly above other letters
    appearing in medieval Germanic manuscripts, and so these glyphs do not
    include spacing, for example uͤ. They are shown here over the dotted circle
    placeholder ◌: ◌ͣ ◌ͤ ◌ͥ ◌ͦ ◌ͧ ◌ͨ ◌ͩ ◌ͪ ◌ͫ ◌ͬ ◌ͭ ◌ͮ ◌ͯ.
  • The Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement block contains additional
    medieval superscript letter diacritics, enough to complete the basic
    lowercase Latin alphabet except for j, q and y, a few small capitals and
    ligatures (ae, ao, av), and additional letters: ◌ᷓ ◌ᷔ ◌ᷕ ◌ᷖ ◌ᷗ ◌ᷘ ◌ᷙ ◌ᷚ ◌ᷛ
    ◌ᷜ ◌ᷝ ◌ᷞ ◌ᷟ ◌ᷠ ◌ᷡ ◌ᷢ ◌ᷣ ◌ᷤ ◌ᷥ ◌ᷦ ◌ᷧ ◌ᷨ ◌ᷩ ◌ᷪ ◌ᷫ ◌ᷬ ◌ᷭ ◌ᷮ ◌ᷯ ◌ᷰ ◌ᷱ ◌ᷲ ◌ᷳ ◌ᷴ.
    There is also a combining subscript: ◌᷊.
  • The Spacing Modifier Letters block has superscripted letters and symbols
    used for phonetic transcription: ʰ ʱ ʲ ʳ ʴ ʵ ʶ ʷ ʸ ˀ ˁ ˠ ˡ ˢ ˣ ˤ.
  • The Phonetic Extensions block has several sub- and super-scripted letters
    and symbols: Latin/IPA ᴬ ᴭ ᴮ ᴯ ᴰ ᴱ ᴲ ᴳ ᴴ ᴵ ᴶ ᴷ ᴸ ᴹ ᴺ ᴻ ᴼ ᴽ ᴾ ᴿ ᵀ ᵁ ᵂ ᵃ ᵄ ᵅ

    Cyrillic ᵸ, other ᵎ ᵔ ᵕ ᵙ ᵜ. These are intended to indicate secondary
    articulation.
  • The Phonetic Extensions Supplement block has several more: Latin/IPA ᶛ ᶜ ᶝ
    ᶞ ᶟ ᶠ ᶡ ᶢ ᶣ ᶤ ᶥ ᶦ ᶧ ᶨ ᶩ ᶪ ᶫ ᶬ ᶭ ᶮ ᶯ ᶰ ᶱ ᶲ ᶳ ᶴ ᶵ ᶶ ᶷ ᶸ ᶹ ᶺ ᶻ ᶼ ᶽ ᶾ, Greek ᶿ.
  • The Cyrillic Extended-B block contains two Cyrillic superscripts: ꚜ ꚝ.
  • The Cyrillic Extended-A and -B blocks contains multiple medieval
    superscript letter diacritics, enough to complete the basic lowercase
    Cyrillic alphabet used in Church Slavonic texts, also includes an
    additional ligature (ст): ◌ⷠ ◌ⷡ ◌ⷢ ◌ⷣ ◌ⷤ ◌ⷥ ◌ⷦ ◌ⷧ ◌ⷨ ◌ⷩ ◌ⷪ ◌ⷫ ◌ⷬ ◌ⷭ ◌ⷮ ◌ⷯ
    ◌ⷰ ◌ⷱ ◌ⷲ ◌ⷳ ◌ⷴ ◌ⷵ ◌ⷶ ◌ⷷ ◌ⷸ ◌ⷹ ◌ⷺ ◌ⷻ ◌ⷼ ◌ⷽ ◌ⷾ ◌ⷿ ◌ꙴ ◌ꙵ ◌ꙶ ◌ꙷ ◌ꙸ ◌ꙹ ◌ꙺ ◌ꙻ ◌ꚞ
    ◌ꚟ.
  • The Georgian block contains one superscripted Mkhedruli letter: ჼ.
  • The Kanbun block has superscripted annotation characters used in Japanese
    copies of Classical Chinese texts: ㆒㆓㆔㆕㆖㆗㆘㆙㆚㆛㆜㆝㆞㆟.
  • The Tifinagh block has one superscript letter : ⵯ.

Composite characters[edit]

Primarily for compatibility with earlier character sets, Unicode contains a
number of characters that compose super- and subscripts with other symbols.^[1]
In most fonts these render much better than attempts to construct these symbols
from the above characters or by using markup.

  • The Latin-1 Supplement block contains the precomposed fractions ½, ¼, and
    ¾. The copyright © and registered trademark signs ® are also in this block.
  • The General Punctuation block contains the permille sign ‰ and the
    per-ten-thousand sign ‱.
  • The Number Forms block contains several precomposed fractions: ⅐ ⅑ ⅒ ⅓ ⅔ ⅕
    ⅖ ⅗ ⅘ ⅙ ⅚ ⅛ ⅜ ⅝ ⅞ ⅟ ↉.
  • The Letterlike Symbols block contains a few symbols composed of subscript
    and superscript characters: ℀ ℁ ℅ ℆ № ℠ ™ ⅍.
  • The Enclosed Alphanumeric Supplement block contains two superscript
    abbreviations: 🅪 🅫 (MC for marque de commerce and MD for marque déposée,
    both used in Canada)
  • The Miscellaneous Technical block has one additional subscript, a subscript
    10 (⏨), for the purpose of scientific notation.
