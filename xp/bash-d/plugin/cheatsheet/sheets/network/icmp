This article is about the protocol as used with Internet Protocol version 4.
For the protocol as used with Internet Protocol version 6, see ICMPv6.

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the main protocols of
the Internet Protocol Suite. It is used by network devices, like routers, to
send error messages indicating, for example, that a requested service is not
available or that a host or router could not be reached. ICMP can also be used
to relay query messages.^[1] It is assigned protocol number 1.^[2] ICMP^[3]
differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP in that it is not
typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed
by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools
like ping and traceroute).

Technical details[edit]

The Internet Control Message Protocol is part of the Internet Protocol Suite,
as defined in RFC 792. ICMP messages are typically used for diagnostic or
control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations (as
specified in RFC 1122). ICMP errors are directed to the source IP address of
the originating packet.^[1]

For example, every device (such as an intermediate router) forwarding an IP
datagram first decrements the time to live (TTL) field in the IP header by one.
If the resulting TTL is 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP Time To Live
exceeded in transit message is sent to the datagram's source address.

Although ICMP messages are contained within standard IP packets, ICMP messages
are usually processed as a special case, distinguished from normal IP
processing, rather than processed as a normal sub-protocol of IP. In many
cases, it is necessary to inspect the contents of the ICMP message and deliver
the appropriate error message to the application that generated the original IP
packet, the one that sent the packet that prompted the sending of the ICMP
message.

Many commonly used network utilities are based on ICMP messages. The traceroute
command can be implemented by transmitting IP datagrams with specially set IP
TTL header fields, and looking for ICMP Time to live exceeded in transit
(above) and "Destination unreachable" messages generated in response. The
related ping utility is implemented using the ICMP "Echo request" and "Echo
reply" messages.

ICMP segment structure[edit]

Header[edit]

The ICMP header starts after the IPv4 header and is identified by IP protocol
number '1'. All ICMP packets have an 8-byte header and variable-sized data
section. The first 4 bytes of the header have fixed format, while the last 4
bytes depend on the type/code of that ICMP packet.^[1]

                                        ICMP Header Format
Offsets Octet        0                  1                      2                       3

Type
    ICMP type, see Control messages.
Code
    ICMP subtype, see Control messages.
Checksum
    Error checking data, calculated from the ICMP header and data, with value 0
    substituted for this field. The Internet Checksum is used, specified in RFC
    1071.
Rest of Header
    Four-bytes field, contents vary based on the ICMP type and code.

Data[edit]

ICMP error messages contain a data section that includes the entire IPv4
header, plus the first eight bytes of data from the IPv4 packet that caused the
error message. The ICMP packet is then encapsulated in a new IPv4 packet.^[1]

The variable size of the ICMP packet data section has been exploited. In the
well-known "Ping of death," large or fragmented ping packets are used for
denial-of-service attacks. ICMP can also be used to create covert channels for
communication, as with the LOKI exploit.^[4]

Source quench[edit]

Source Quench requests that the sender decrease the rate of messages sent to a
router or host. This message may be generated if a router or host does not have
sufficient buffer space to process the request, or may occur if the router or
host buffer is approaching its limit.

Data is sent at a very high speed from a host or from several hosts at the same
time to a particular router on a network. Although a router has buffering
capabilities, the buffering is limited to within a specified range. The router
cannot queue any more data than the capacity of the limited buffering space.
Thus if the queue gets filled up, incoming data is discarded until the queue is
no longer full. But as no acknowledgement mechanism is present in the network
layer, the client does not know whether the data has reached the destination
successfully. Hence some remedial measures should be taken by the network layer
to avoid these kind of situations. These measures are referred to as source
quench. In a source quench mechanism, the router sees that the incoming data
rate is much faster than the outgoing data rate, and sends an ICMP message to
the clients, informing them that they should slow down their data transfer
speeds or wait for a certain amount of time before attempting to send more
data. When a client receives this message, it will automatically slow down the
outgoing data rate or wait for a sufficient amount of time, which enables the
router to empty the queue. Thus the source quench ICMP message acts as flow
control in the network layer.

Since research suggested that ICMP Source Quench was an ineffective (and
unfair) antidote for congestion, routers' creation of source quench messages
was deprecated in 1995 by RFC 1812. Furthermore, forwarding of and any kind of
reaction to (flow control actions) source quench messages was deprecated from
2012 by RFC 6633.

    IP header and additional data is used by the sender to match the reply with
    the associated request

Redirect[edit]

Redirect requests data packets be sent on an alternative route. ICMP Redirect
is a mechanism for routers to convey routing information to hosts. The message
informs a host to update its routing information (to send packets on an
alternative route). If a host tries to send data through a router (R1) and R1
sends the data on another router (R2) and a direct path from the host to R2 is
available (that is, the host and R2 are on the same Ethernet segment), then R1
will send a redirect message to inform the host that the best route for the
destination is via R2. The host should then send packets for the destination
directly to R2. The router will still send the original datagram to the
intended destination.^[7] However, if the datagram contains routing
information, this message will not be sent even if a better route is available.
RFC 1122 states that redirects should only be sent by gateways and should not
be sent by Internet hosts.

    Code specifies the reason for the redirection, may be one of the following:

        Code               Description
         0   Redirect for Network
         1   Redirect for Host
         2   Redirect for Type of Service and Network
         3   Redirect for Type of Service and Host

    IP address is the 32-bit address of the gateway to which the redirection
    should be sent.
    IP header and additional data is included to allow the host to match the
    reply with the request that caused the redirection reply.

Time exceeded[edit]

Time Exceeded is generated by a gateway to inform the source of a discarded
datagram due to the time to live field reaching zero. A time exceeded message
may also be sent by a host if it fails to reassemble a fragmented datagram
within its time limit.

Time exceeded messages are used by the traceroute utility to identify gateways
on the path between two hosts.

        Code            Description
         0   Time-to-live exceeded in transit.
         1   Fragment reassembly time exceeded.

    IP header and first 64 bits of the original payload are used by the source
    host to match the time exceeded message to the discarded datagram. For
    higher level protocols such as UDP and TCP the 64 bit payload will include
    the source and destination ports of the discarded packet.

Timestamp[edit]

Timestamp is used for time synchronization. The originating timestamp is set to
the time (in milliseconds since midnight) the sender last touched the packet.
The receive and transmit timestamps are not used.

Transmit timestamp

Where:

    Type must be set to 13
    Code must be set to 0
    Identifier and Sequence Number can be used by the client to match the
    timestamp reply with the timestamp request.
    Originate timestamp is the number of milliseconds since midnight Universal
    Time (UT). If a UT reference is not available the most-significant bit can
    be set to indicate a non-standard time value.

Timestamp reply[edit]

Timestamp Reply replies to a Timestamp message. It consists of the originating
timestamp sent by the sender of the Timestamp as well as a receive timestamp
indicating when the Timestamp was received and a transmit timestamp indicating
when the Timestamp reply was sent.

Where:

    Type must be set to 14
    Code must be set to 0
    Identifier and Sequence number can be used by the client to match the reply
    with the request that caused the reply.
    Originate timestamp is the time the sender last touched the message before
    sending it.
    Receive timestamp is the time the echoer first touched it on receipt.
    Transmit timestamp is the time the echoer last touched the message on
    sending it.

    All timestamps are in units of milliseconds since midnight UT. If the time
    is not available in milliseconds or cannot be provided with respect to
    midnight UT then any time can be inserted in a timestamp provided the high
    order bit of the timestamp is also set to indicate this non-standard value.

Address mask request[edit]

Address mask request is normally sent by a host to a router in order to obtain
an appropriate subnet mask.

Recipients should reply to this message with an Address mask reply message.

                                     Address mask request

    Code must be set to 0
    Address mask should be set to the subnet mask

Destination unreachable[edit]

Destination unreachable is generated by the host or its inbound gateway^[3] to
inform the client that the destination is unreachable for some reason. A
Destination Unreachable message may be generated as a result of a TCP, UDP or
another ICMP transmission. Unreachable TCP ports notably respond with TCP RST
rather than a Destination Unreachable type 3 as might be expected.

The error will not be generated if the original datagram has a multicast
destination address. Reasons for this message may include: the physical
connection to the host does not exist (distance is infinite); the indicated
protocol or port is not active; the data must be fragmented but the 'don't
fragment' flag is on.

         4   The datagram is too big. Packet fragmentation is required but the
             'don't fragment' (DF) flag is on.
         5   Source route failed error.
         6   Destination network unknown error.
         7   Destination host unknown error.
         8   Source host isolated error.
         9   The destination network is administratively prohibited.
         10  The destination host is administratively prohibited.
         11  The network is unreachable for Type Of Service.
         12  The host is unreachable for Type Of Service.
         13  Communication administratively prohibited (administrative
             filtering prevents packet from being forwarded).
         14  Host precedence violation (indicates the requested precedence is
             not permitted for the combination of host or network and port).
         15  Precedence cutoff in effect (precedence of datagram is below the
             level set by the network administrators).

    Next-hop MTU field (bits 48-63) contains the MTU of the next-hop network if
    a code 4 error occurs.
    IP header and additional data is included to allow the client to match the
    reply with the request that caused the destination unreachable reply.
