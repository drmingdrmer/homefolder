# For Application-specific commands, use the following:

defaults write com.developer.app NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Menu Item" -string "@$~^k"


The meta-keys are set as
 @ for Command
 $ for Shift
 ~ for Alt
 ^ for Ctrl.

 k in this example is the non-meta-key that you want to use.

For system-wide shortcuts, you can use -g instead of the app identifier, e.g.

defaults write -g NSUserKeyEquivalents -dict-add "Menu Item" -string "@$~^k"
Note that you'll need to relaunch the app before these will take effect. Also
you can see if they've been successful in System Preferences -- which will
also need a relaunch to show the changes.
